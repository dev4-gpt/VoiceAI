StratosGTM is a voice agent for people who sell high-ticket offers. A visitor talks to it on your site, it qualifies them
and writes the lead into a CRM, and the same conversations feed a content pipeline that can publish. This is a full
account of how it works, including the parts that broke this week and the parts that are not built.

## 1. The problem we are aimed at

If you sell a program, a retainer or a service worth $2,000 or more, one extra qualified lead is worth real money. The
lead who visits at 11pm and finds nothing to talk to may not come back. Most tools that answer that are phone-first or
built for large support teams. We are building for the founder, creator or agency owner who wants the visitor
qualified while they sleep, and wants the conversation to feed what they publish next.

## 2. The system, end to end

A visitor's browser connects to a web console or an embeddable widget. The server checks consent, gating and usage, then
mints a short-lived token for AssemblyAI's Voice Agent API. The browser then streams audio straight to AssemblyAI; our
server never carries the audio and the browser never sees the real key. When the agent decides to act, AssemblyAI
sends a tool call to our server, which applies guardrails and writes to a Postgres CRM. Language work (chat, content,
Buyer Lab) goes to DeepSeek. Sign-in is Google through Neon Auth, and every account gets a private workspace.

The pieces: a React and Vite front end and an Express and TypeScript API, both on Vercel; Neon for Postgres and auth;
Stripe for billing (test mode); and a small self-hosted publishing server on Railway. A diagram with every part labeled
by how real it is lives at `docs/gtm/architecture.html`.

## 3. The voice loop and its seven tools

The agent registers seven tools with the voice API. We read them from the live app:

| Tool | What it does | Honest status |
|---|---|---|
| `create_or_update_lead` | Writes the lead to the CRM | Real |
| `qualify_lead` | Records budget, timeline and fit | Real |
| `enrich_prospect_dossier` | Builds a prospect dossier | Real when the language model is configured |
| `get_product_knowledge` | Answers product questions | A keyword lookup over four documents, not real retrieval |
| `schedule_growth_consultation` | Records a consultation request | Writes a confirmation code on the lead. It is not a calendar |
| `process_retention_offer` | Handles a churn-save conversation | Real, with a hard discount ceiling |
| `run_content_factory` | Starts the content pipeline | Real when configured |

Two things we insist on. First, **the model proposes and the application enforces**: the agent can ask for a discount,
but the server clamps it to a fixed ceiling, so the agent cannot give away margin. Second, **consent comes first**. The
server prepends an AI disclosure and asks for explicit opt-in in the 13 all-party-consent states (California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania and Washington), with the strictest policy when the location is unknown. Consent records are append-only.
This is an engineering implementation, not legal advice.

What we have not measured: **time to first audio**. There is client-side measurement code, but no calls are recorded
yet, so we quote no speed figure at all.

## 4. From conversation to content

The content pipeline runs Research, Voice, Create, then Publish. It turns conversation topics into drafts for X,
LinkedIn and Substack. When the language model is not configured, it returns an honest placeholder flagged as a
fallback, never invented metrics or testimonials.

## 5. The publishing bridge, and why it is built this way

Publishing to many networks means one OAuth integration and one set of rules per network. Rather than build each, we
wrap an open-source project called TryPost and call it over HTTP. It is AGPL-licensed, so we run it as a separate
service, keep the source in a public fork, and only change its build and worker configuration.

The tenant model is simple. Each workspace saves its own TryPost token, encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a per-row data
key, and shown only as its last four characters. Before any post, the server checks that the chosen account belongs to
that workspace's own list of accounts. One workspace can never post through another's account.

Publishing is two calls, which we learned by testing. **Creating a post in TryPost always makes a draft**, even if you
send a schedule time. Publishing is a second call that sets the status to `publishing`. Then we read the status back.
The receipt says **published** only when TryPost itself reports it. Anything less reads **queued**, and every receipt
carries an `isSimulated` flag derived in exactly one place. We proved the whole path on 2026-09-26: text typed into the
app appeared on a Bluesky account.

## 6. What broke this week

We would rather show these than hide them.

- **A success that was not one.** Our first publish call returned success and nothing posted. The draft-versus-publish
  behavior above was the cause. The honest receipt kept saying "queued", which is what led us to the answer.
- **More than 3,000 out-of-memory kills.** The publishing server runs in 1 GB. Its default configuration starts one
  worker per social network, and the kernel had killed more than three thousand processes by the time we looked. The fix
  was to turn off every network we do not use.
- **Zero workers, from a rounding error.** We capped one worker group at 2 workers across 14 queues. The scheduler
  divides the cap across queues and rounds down, so every queue got none, and posts sat forever. A second config
  mistake then stopped the whole queue system from starting. Both are documented so nobody repeats them.
- **A bad signing key.** Creating an API key returned a server error because the key was pasted without its header
  lines. The library only accepts the full format.
- **Two projects, one name.** Sign-in failed on a new domain because we had trusted the domain in the wrong auth
  project. The lesson: when a change does nothing, check you edited the right thing.

## 7. Buyer Lab, and why its claims are checkable

Buyer Lab runs simulated buyers over a page or offer. The rule that makes it usable: **every claim must carry a verbatim
quote found in the material that persona was shown**. Claims without one are dropped and counted, and the report cites
claim ids only. It never produces a probability, conversion or revenue figure. In one real-model check on a public site,
6 personas produced 45 kept claims and 3 dropped ones, and 6 model calls cost a few cents. These are hypotheses, not
measurements, and the tool says so.

## 8. Trust, keys and cost

There are no free credits. A workspace uses its own keys, or an owner grants it the server's, or it needs a paid plan.
Keys are encrypted per workspace and never logged. The plans are Starter at $149 a month (500 voice minutes), Pro at
$449 (1,500) and Enterprise at $1,497 (5,000), with overage per minute. The voice provider's cost is $0.075 a minute,
which leaves about 75% gross margin before payment fees on monthly plans.

## 9. What is not built

- Time to first audio is unmeasured, so no speed claim.
- No calendar booking.
- Product knowledge is four documents, not real retrieval.
- Only Bluesky auto-publishes. X and LinkedIn need credentials; Instagram, Facebook and others need their own app
  registration. YouTube is a labeled stub.
- Billing is in test mode.
- Sign-in uses shared development Google keys and should move to our own client before real customers.
- Widget calls are not metered.
- No duplicate protection on Publish yet.

## 10. What we want next

We are looking for three founders, creators or agencies selling offers of $2,000 and up to run a paid 30-day pilot.
You get setup help and a weekly review; we get honest feedback. If that is you, reply to the post that links here.
You can try the demo at stratosgtm.vercel.app. It is early, and it is rough in places.

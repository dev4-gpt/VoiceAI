### Prepared for: DesignAcademy Studio (Jason Miller)
**Audience Footprint:** 120k Substack Subscribers • 15k Design Community • 5 Platform Channels
**Core Challenge:** International Timezone Latency & $114,000 Pipeline Dropoff

---

### Executive Summary
When high-ticket prospects visit https://designacademy.io from Europe or Asia, their intent is highest in the first 5 minutes. Every hour of delay degrades conversion probability exponentially.

### The 3-Step Remediation Plan:
1. **Instant Voice Discovery Call:** When a prospect submits their portfolio or email, offer an instant 2-minute voice discovery call with Anna.
2. **Autonomous BANT Scoring:** Verify timeline, portfolio stage, and $2,997 budget tier dynamically.
3. **Risk-Reversal Closing:** Offer the 14-Day Action Guarantee on the spot, booking the student directly into the onboarding cohort.`

1. **Instant Voice Callback:** Eliminate the 5-minute lead decay cliff.
2. **Autonomous BANT Triage:** Protect advisor calendars by qualifying high-ticket accounts in real-time.
3. **Risk-Reversal Action Guarantee:** Reframe pricing hesitation into guaranteed outcomes.`
